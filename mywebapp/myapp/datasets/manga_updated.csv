Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.

He always tells stories of his friend, a cyborg hero named Kamen Rider, who years ago in Japan brought down the evil organization Shocker, saving people from monsters and never seeking any reward for his deeds. However, the only ones who believe his tales are a group of orphans he has befriended. When one of the orphans is transformed into a monster, Taki tracks down the creature responsible and attempts to fight it in his own costume, calling himself a new Kamen Rider. However, he fares poorly against it and is on the verge of being killed. At that moment, none other than Takeshi Hongo, the original Kamen Rider, comes to his rescue. Hongo and a newly inspired Taki team up and manage to defeat the creatures. Afterward, Hongo informs Taki that a new danger is rising to threaten humanity and asks for his help before setting off to find more allies, the eight other Kamen Riders with whom he was once a team. Taki continues his work with Interpol, along with assisting Hongo's search.
